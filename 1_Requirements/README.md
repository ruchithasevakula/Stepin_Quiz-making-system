# Requirements
## Introduction
This is a complete and error-free Quiz Game Mini Project in C designed as a simple console application. In this project, a number of questions are asked, and the user is awarded cash prize for each correct answer given.
I have divided this mini project into many functions, and listed below are some of those which may help you understand the project better.
* edit_score() – adds the current cash prize won to the previous one upon giving the right answer to a question
* help() – help menu with game summary and rules
* reset_score() – to reset the highest score/cash prize to default
* show_record() – shows the highest cash prize won by a particular user
* show_score() – to view the highest score
* In this quiz game mini project, you can store the user name, view the highest score secured by a user, and even reset the score. Additionally, to make the game look a little more interesting, it is divided into two rounds; user must pass the first round to reach the second one.

* Of the 2 rounds I mentioned above, the first is called the Warm-up Round; the second is the Challenge round. In the warm-up round, the user is asked a total of three simple questions and they must be able to answer at least two of them correctly to enter the next round. If the user is not capable of doing that, he is not permitted to proceed further.
## Objective

* To solve the Quiz questions.
